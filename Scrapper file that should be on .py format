Here's how the script works:

It sends an HTTP GET request to the specified URL.
If the request is successful (status code 200), it parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup.
You need to adapt the code within the scrape method to extract the data you want from the HTML structure of the specific website you are scraping.
The extracted data is then saved to a CSV file named 'scraped_data.csv'. You should replace the example column names and data with the actual data you want to scrape.
Please note that web scraping might be subject to legal and ethical considerations. Always check the website's terms of service and robots.txt file to ensure compliance with their policies.
